Hi there!

I’m Chris, the creator of this site. To be honest, I’m not entirely sure what this site is -or what it will become- but it’ll reflect my interests, curiosity, projects, and learning.

If you're curious about how this site was built, check out the [colophon](/colophon/) for the details.

Thanks for stopping by! Check back soon to see how it evolves. Have a great day!

—Chris

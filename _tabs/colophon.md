This site was built by the author using [Chirpy](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy), a fantastic Jekyll theme. Itâ€™s hosted on GitHub Pages with automatic deployment powered by Git and GitHub Actions. For local development and content creation, I used VS Code, Docker, the Dev Containers extension, and Markdown.

Chirpy leverages several amazing open-source projects under the hood. 

[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/): For static site generation.
[MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/): For rendering beautiful math equations.
[Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/): For stylish social and navigation icons.
[Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/): For responsive, mobile-friendly design.

The site was tested locally using Google Chrome on a Windows 11 machine.

Thank you for visiting and for supporting the open-source ecosystem that makes this possible.
